      "startDate": "2023",
      "description": "This project revolves around conducting data analysis of various third-party applications by intercepting and scrutinizing their network traffic. Using an emulator setup, we targeted applications sourced from apkmirror, aiming to uncover the nature of data collection within these apps. The progression of work spans multiple phases, encompassing environment configuration, data gathering, process automation, and leveraging mitmproxy for traffic analysis. Wireless debugging facilitated device-host pairing, allowing the execution of adb commands for both pairing and monkey fuzzing. Diverse categories of third-party Android apps, such as shopping and entertainment, were selectively collected as APKs for analysis. Automation played a pivotal role, achieved through a Python script orchestrating the seamless installation of apps on the emulator. This automation encompassed the initiation of mitmproxy, app launch, pinning the app to the screen, fuzzing, subsequent unpinning, and closure of the app. Captured mitmproxy flow data underwent pre-processing to organize requests and responses into a text-based format, streamlining the subsequent analysis. The project’s comprehensive approach towards app analysis through network traffic interception and automation paves the way for discerning insights into the data collection practices across a spectrum of third-party Android applications.",

      "description": "This project primarily emphasized backend enhancements, resulting in a notable 50% increase in data processing speed for visualizing XY data using data thinning techniques. This improvement is especially crucial for time series datasets with over 1 million data points. On the frontend, the default representation of data is a scatter plot. In this visualization, the marker fill color corresponds to the y-axis signal, while the marker border color matches the x-axis signal. Users have the flexibility to choose between displaying only markers, only lines, or a combination of both markers and connecting lines by selecting or clearing the Line and Markers options. To illustrate the impact of these changes, the first image demonstrates that when plotting data with a length of 1 million points, the system experiences delays and unresponsiveness. In contrast, the second image, following our improvements, showcases data plotting and smooth cursor operations, demonstrating a significant performance boost.",

One of the key enhancements was the introduction of a 'Limits' section within the settings panel of XY visualization. This feature aimed to streamline the user experience by allowing direct adjustments to the canvas limits. Unlike the previous method where users had to manually pan or zoom the canvas to view updated limits, this new feature enabled users to precisely navigate to a specific grid location on the canvas by providing input in the limits section of the settings panel. Moreover, to ensure persistence and continuity of this feature across multiple XY visualizations, the data was efficiently stored in a database. This approach ensured that the limits of each subplot remained intact and functional when the Simulink Data Inspector was reopened or reloaded.",

A logical 2D matrix representing the MathWorks office map was provided as input to the algorithm, where 'TRUE' denoted a visitable map cell and 'FALSE' indicated an impassable cell. The algorithm excelled in finding the shortest and most efficient paths throughout the map. Users could query the bot by providing source and destination points, and in response, the bot generated an image highlighting the map with clear directions, simplifying navigation within the office environment.",

Prior to this addition, there was no clear indicator to distinguish which signals were being plotted on the map visualization in SDI.

The primary aim of this endeavor was to extract the precise locations of traffic lights within these databases. As part of this project, I developed APIs that were tailored to the specific task of parsing and collecting the exact positions of traffic lights from the above mentioned databases. Subsequently, these positions were mapped to the various lanes within junctions within a simulated road network environment. My role then was extended to implement algorithms designed to serve two primary functions: ensuring the effective functionality of traffic lights and proficiently detecting lanes and junctions within road networks defined by the user. This project was a significant part of my internship, offering a valuable opportunity to explore, develop, and contribute to the realm of road network analysis and traffic light management.",
