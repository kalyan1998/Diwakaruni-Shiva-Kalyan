      "startDate": "2024",
      "description": "In this project, I developed a serverless web application using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to provide users with real-time feedback on the likelihood of uploaded text content being a deepfake. The application utilized advanced natural language processing models, including BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2, along with the GLTR and GRUEN metrics to analyze and detect deepfake texts. To enhance the accuracy of the detection models, the training data was augmented with adversarial samples generated by the DFT Fooler algorithm. This approach improved the robustness of the models and increased their ability to identify sophisticated deepfake texts, providing users with a reliable tool for assessing the authenticity of textual content.",

      "startDate": "2023",
      "description": "This project revolves around conducting data analysis of various third-party applications by intercepting and scrutinizing their network traffic. Using an emulator setup, we targeted applications sourced from apkmirror, aiming to uncover the nature of data collection within these apps. The progression of work spans multiple phases, encompassing environment configuration, data gathering, process automation, and leveraging mitmproxy for traffic analysis. Wireless debugging facilitated device-host pairing, allowing the execution of adb commands for both pairing and monkey fuzzing. Diverse categories of third-party Android apps, such as shopping and entertainment, were selectively collected as APKs for analysis. Automation played a pivotal role, achieved through a Python script orchestrating the seamless installation of apps on the emulator. This automation encompassed the initiation of mitmproxy, app launch, pinning the app to the screen, fuzzing, subsequent unpinning, and closure of the app. Captured mitmproxy flow data underwent pre-processing to organize requests and responses into a text-based format, streamlining the subsequent analysis. The project’s comprehensive approach towards app analysis through network traffic interception and automation paves the way for discerning insights into the data collection practices across a spectrum of third-party Android applications.",
