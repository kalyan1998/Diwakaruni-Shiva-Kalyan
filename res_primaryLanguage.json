      "startDate": "2023",
      "description": "This project revolves around conducting data analysis of various third-party applications by intercepting and scrutinizing their network traffic. Using an emulator setup, we targeted applications sourced from apkmirror, aiming to uncover the nature of data collection within these apps. The progression of work spans multiple phases, encompassing environment configuration, data gathering, process automation, and leveraging mitmproxy for traffic analysis. Wireless debugging facilitated device-host pairing, allowing the execution of adb commands for both pairing and monkey fuzzing. Diverse categories of third-party Android apps, such as shopping and entertainment, were selectively collected as APKs for analysis. Automation played a pivotal role, achieved through a Python script orchestrating the seamless installation of apps on the emulator. This automation encompassed the initiation of mitmproxy, app launch, pinning the app to the screen, fuzzing, subsequent unpinning, and closure of the app. Captured mitmproxy flow data underwent pre-processing to organize requests and responses into a text-based format, streamlining the subsequent analysis. The projectâ€™s comprehensive approach towards app analysis through network traffic interception and automation paves the way for discerning insights into the data collection practices across a spectrum of third-party Android applications.",

By implementing data thinning techniques and utilizing a scalable C++ concurrent queue service, we achieved a notable reduction in latency by approximately 30 seconds for large data transfers between the frontend and backend, while efficiently handling high-volume message queues. On the frontend, users can visualize data in a scatter plot, with options to display markers, lines, or both, enhancing interactivity and responsiveness. The improvements are demonstrated by the smooth cursor operations and quick data plotting in large datasets, showcasing a substantial enhancement in system performance and user experience.",

This bot harnessed the power of the A* algorithm and was adapted in this project to assist users in navigating within extensive office spaces or work environments. A logical 2D matrix representing the MathWorks office map was provided as input to the algorithm, where 'TRUE' denoted a visitable map cell and 'FALSE' indicated an impassable cell. The algorithm excelled in finding the shortest and most efficient paths throughout the map. Users could query the bot by providing source and destination points, and in response, the bot generated an image highlighting the map with clear directions, simplifying navigation within the office environment.",

I architected APIs with an optimized latency of approximately 10ms to render traffic lights from Open Street Maps (OSM) and HERE HD, enabling accurate mapping of traffic light positions to lanes within junctions. I represented the traffic network as a graph and scaled the design to support automatic scenario generation and simulation. Additionally, I created a MATLAB simulation replicating traffic light functionality, which resulted in a 40% improvement in junction detection accuracy. Throughout the project, I facilitated and presented knowledge-sharing meetings focused on advanced technologies such as Deep Learning (DL) and Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), contributing to the team's overall understanding and capabilities in these areas.",
